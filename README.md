## Robust UAV Visual Teach and Repeat Using Only Sparse Semantic Object Features ##
#### In CRV 2018 [[Demo Video]](https://youtu.be/7155GQHPIZA)

This is a proof-of-concept project trying to show that the navigation can be done using only sparse semantic object features. With the help of recent advances in Deep Learning, state-of-the-art object detectors are light-, condition, viewpoint-invariant oppose to low-level traditional features such as SIFT, SURF, etc.

This is ROS-based implementation of our [CRV 2018 paper on robust UAV visual teach and repeat using only sparse semantic object features](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07899).
